## General info
This is supposed to be resume app to share with others. Let's see how it's gonna develop.  
To begin with I'll focus on front end technologies, as this is what I'm currently dealing at my work. I'm planning to write just a sample back end Spring Boot application with User model to share some data to be displayed in UI.

---
## Technologies
*BACK END:*
* Programming language: *Java* 17.
* Frameworks: 
  * *Spring  Boot* 2.6.7, 
  * *Hibernate*. 
* Data base: *MariaDB 10.3.3*.
* Other projects: *Lombok*.

FRONT END:
 * to be specified, but I think it will be an Angular project.

What's ready vs. what will be ready:
- [ ] Spring Boot application with DB config to store User data (maybe extended to CRUD in the future)
- [ ] UI (probably Angular app)
